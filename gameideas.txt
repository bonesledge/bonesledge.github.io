visual art organisms on a website
like you draw a 3d organism similarly to this http://weavesilk.com/
and then unleash it in a sort of simulation of an ocean environment
then make more
and they interact and multiply and mutate like bacteria or protists
and it makes like a flowing artwork world

there are flows
In the ocean
rather than it being a void
like currents

i was thinking the organisms have trails, like you can see where they have been, like these exhaust streams in Homeworld
in addition to the current of the water
well the movement of organisms affects the flow of water in fluid dynamics
but i guess
maybe you birth the organisms
and then in order to influence them
nudge them
you can alter the flows of current
and there will be lots of vortices

next step:
boids in fluid
